# Spain-electricity-shortfall
The government of Spain is considering an expansion of its renewable energy resource infrastructure investments. 
As such, they require information on the trends and patterns of the country's renewable sources and fossil fuel energy generation. 
For this very reason, the government of Spain has been tracking the different energy sources available within the country.
In this project, you are tasked to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain. 
The daily shortfall, which will be referred to as the target variable, will be modelled as a function of various 
city-specific weather features such as `pressure`, `wind speed`, `humidity`, etc.
